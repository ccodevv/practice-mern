# Practice MERN Project

This repository contains a practice project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project aims to help improve skills in full-stack web development by implementing a basic web application using these technologies.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple full-stack application where the backend is built with Node.js and Express.js connected to MongoDB, and the frontend is developed with React.js. It serves as a learning resource and a starting point for MERN stack applications.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
- Axios (for HTTP requests)
